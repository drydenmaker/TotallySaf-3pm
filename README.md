# TotallySaf-3pm
Just a fun example of unitrix style for testing. It builds an executable that looks like an MP3 file because it reverses the last 7 characters from "3pm.exe" to "exe.mp3".

Grab a release binary and see if it makes it through file uploads to become an epic fake Trojan.

In the future I would like to play with these sorts of characters in code to see if I can do some obfustication.
